    <!-- Locations -->
    <div class="lore-box">
      <h2>üåç Places</h2>
      <h3>üèîÔ∏è Asgard</h3>
      <p>Asgard is an afterlife location home to gods, based off of norse mythology. Asgard is connected to Brawlhalla as it is home to Valhalla, where all combat in Brawlhalla takes place.</p>
      
      <h3>üèüÔ∏è Valhalla</h3>
      <p>Valhalla is the main location where the battle takes place, and can be seen depicted on the map The Great Hall. This is based on the Norse mythological Valhalla, a great hall in Asgard for warriors who have died in combat. As such, most of the Legends of Valhalla have come here through death in combat, and are destined to fight forever. There are a few Legends who didn't die in combat and are still in Valhalla, however:
        <ul>
          <li>- B√∂dvar, who broke down the doors of Valhalla and entered himself, as he felt he would never be defeated in battle.</li>
          <li>- Brynn, who was born in Valhalla.</li>
          <li>- Orion, who mysteriously fell from the Asgardian sky.</li>
          <li>- Ulgrim, who is one of The Sons of Ivaldi and has always been in Asgard.</li>
          <li>- Kor, who was built by Elven sorcerers for combat against Asgard. Also, Kor has his job as a platform mover in Valhalla.</li>
          <li>- Sir Roland, who was punched by the Valkyrie Hypernia as an old man on his deathbed, so he could technically die in battle.</li>
          <li>- Thor, who is the son of Odin.</li>
          <li>- Munin, who, along with her sister Hugin, are the messengers of Odin and thus live somewhere within Asgard.</li>

    <!-- Groups -->
    <div class="lore-box">
      <h2>ü§ù Groups and Factions</h2>

      <h3><img src="../Brawlhalla/Simboli vari/MBFC_Logo.svg" class="mini-icon" alt="">MBFC</h3>
      <p>Abbreviated as MBFC, this organization is referenced in Ada and Val's lore, and suspiciously seems to work in nanotech (their slogan being "Your Friend in Nanotech"). Their logo can be seen in lots of places, such as Ada's shirt, Val's forehead, High Frequency Yumiko's headphones, and in the background of Miami Dome.</p>

      <h3>üõ°Ô∏è Iron Legion</h3>
      <p>The Iron Legion is a mercenary army serving Azoth‚Äôs empire, originally led by the Troll Titan and later taken over by Xull, who made it wealthy and powerful. Xull recruited by placing a bounty on himself, offering survival and enlistment to those who could endure his attack. Teros was a known member and helped win the Battle of Orc Pass for Azoth. The Iron Legion is featured in skins for Commander Xull, Iron Legion Teros, and Iron Legion Mordex‚Äîthough Mordex‚Äôs connection to the group is unconfirmed.</p>

      <h3>üé∏ Electric Fight Orchestra</h3>
      <p>This "Techno-Fantasy Euro Pop" Band is mentioned in Isaiah's lore, and consists of Isaiah, Ada, Ulgrim, and Fait. This group has been referenced in both official art and in the Welcome to Brawlhalla animated short. The group's name was confirmed in a teaser for a new legend.</p>

      <h3>üìö Book Club</h3>
      <p>As the name implies, this is a ladies' book club in Valhalla. Confirmed members of the club are Scarlet (the group leader), Fait, and Onyx. Xull has also challenged Scarlet for leadership of the group (though he is not actually part of the group).</p>

      <h3>ü¶Å Exalted Lion</h3>
      <p>The Order of the Exalted Lion was a group of hunters who fought monsters in Batavia. Jhala was the first to be titled ‚ÄúExalted Lioness‚Äù by Apollo after uniting Thera against Azoth. Diana and Mordex were later members, but the order was destroyed when Mordex, seeking power, took the Geminus Virens. This story is explored in Battle Pass Season 4, though set in different timelines. Queen Nai, Cross, and Azoth have skins from that season but are not members. Sir Roland was part of the order at an unknown time, and Isaiah is confirmed as the leader of its modern version.</p>
